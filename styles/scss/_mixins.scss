//Mixin lets you group CSS declarations
//into single fuction, like my hover and
//focus rule. You can call this fuction
//any away in the project as long as
//you "@include"ed this file.


//TLDR: Mixin saves time writing code.

@mixin hoverNfocus() {
  &:hover, &:focus {
    @content;
  }
}


//The following code below is a bit of a
//overkill for what I am trying to do.
//None the less, it shows how the function
//works and how mixins can be utilized.


//TLDR: Make text pretty for browsers that support it.

@mixin fontSmoothing($property, $value) {

  -webkit-#{$property}: $value;
  -moz-#{$property}: $value;
}

// Proper implementation antialiased mixin will be:

@mixin smoothFont() {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
